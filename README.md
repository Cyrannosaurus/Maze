Currently a work in progress. The aim is to make an expandable platform for testing search algorithms. Surprisingly, maze generation begins with a way to solve a maze. Breadth First Search is used to test a pseudo-randomly made maze, and slight modifications are made to the maze until a solution is found. My aim is to move past the introductory search algorithms like BFS, DFS, Greedy, AStar to ones that I, at least, am less familiar with. This includes Beam search, iterative deeping applied to any of the previously stated methods, and eventually a learning algorithm.
